    "The problem resembles a **transshipment problem** the most. In a transshipment problem, commodities can be transported directly from sources to destinations, and can also be shipped indirectly via one or more transshipment points where the commodity can change its mode of transportation. In this case, the beer can be shipped directly from factories to retail points or indirectly through warehouses."
